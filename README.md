## Side notes

This version didn't get the time to be well tested, so I chose to use the code in the branch `dummy` for the live board (which just does linear scan).

The `master` brunch holds the latest code I have. The algorithm is illustrated as comments, but 1 hour is too short to get all HTTP stuffs and a full-fledged algorithm to be done.

## Dependencies

* `requests` for HTTP manipulation
